# Libft
Libft - my first C library 

## Description

Libft is a project designed to implement various standard C functions and take the first steps in learning C and its core concepts. 
These functions provide a solid foundation for building programs and will be used in subsequent Common Core projects.

The project covers:

- Basic character and memory manipulation functions
- Memory allocation and release
- String manipulation
- Linked list functions (bonus)

## Instructions

This project includes a Makefile to compile the `Libft` library.
To build it, simply run the following command in your terminal: `make`.

## Resources

- **Peer-to-peer learning** – was the most valuable resource; this project was developed with guidance and collaboration from other 42 students;
- **man pages** – Used extensively to check function behavior, parameters, and return values. (The man from bash!);
- **Tutorials and articles** – Consulted to better understand specific C concepts and function implementations;
- **Books** – Classic references to learn C from scratch and understand various programming notions.

### AI Assistance

AI tools were used to help:
- Create diagrams and schemas to visualize how functions work and how data flows.
- Provide examples of how to apply these concepts in practice.

No AI was used to write the functions directly; all code logic and implementation are my own work and personal vision.
